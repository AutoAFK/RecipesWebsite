# About
This project is the first project of TheOdinProject website.

# What have I learned
In vscode I learned those shortcuts:
- `Alt + Shift + ArrowUp/ArrowDown` - duplicate the line bar line down or up
- `Ctrl + Shift + ArrowUp/ArrowDown` - duplicate the line bar line down or up from the main line bar position.
- `Ctrl + Enter` - New line without breaking the current line
- `Ctrl + d` - duplicate the line bar on the next instance of the word

Github command:
- `git commit --amend` - let you edit the last commit message.
